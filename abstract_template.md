Generalized Parts List Skeleton for DIY NVR Kits
This abstract template outlines the core components for building DIY Network Video Recorders (NVRs) compatible with x86-64 and ARM64 architectures across budget, mid-range, and high-end tiers. Use this skeleton to customize based on performance needs (e.g., number of cameras, resolution), budget, and software (e.g., Frigate). Not all components are mandatory (e.g., AI accelerator is optional without AI features).

Description
Examples by Tier/Architecture
Rationale



Processing Unit
Core hardware for running OS and NVR software. Includes CPU, RAM (8-32GB), and basic I/O.
Budget: Low-power SBC/mini PC (e.g., Raspberry Pi 5 or Intel N100). Mid: Mid-spec board/PC (e.g., RK3588 or N150). High: High-core PC (e.g., Ryzen 9 or advanced ARM).
Handles video processing; x86 for broad software compatibility, ARM for power efficiency.


AI Accelerator
Add-on for object detection/AI offload (USB or integrated).
Budget/Mid/High: USB TPU (e.g., Google Coral); integrated NPU in some ARM boards.
Essential for real-time AI without CPU overload; optional for basic recording.


Primary Storage
Fast storage for OS, software, and cache (256GB-2TB SSD).
Budget: MicroSD/USB SSD. Mid/High: M.2 or internal SSD.
Ensures quick access for applications; SSD preferred for reliability.


Secondary Storage
Bulk storage for video footage (1-4TB HDD or larger SSD).
Budget: External USB HDD. Mid/High: Internal HDD or RAID setup.
Long-term archival; capacity scales with camera count and retention needs.


Networking
PoE switch for camera connectivity and power (4-8 ports).
Budget: Basic unmanaged switch. Mid/High: Managed switch with VLAN support.
Simplifies wiring; stable Ethernet critical for reliable camera streams.


Enclosure & Power
Case, power supply unit, and cooling for the processing unit.
Budget: Basic kit or included case. Mid/High: Custom enclosure with active cooling.
ARM often requires separate enclosure; x86 mini PCs typically include.


Optional Add-ons
Extras like cables, mounts, or backup power solutions.
All Tiers: Ethernet cables, UPS for power backup.
Enhances system reliability and deployment flexibility; add as needed.
